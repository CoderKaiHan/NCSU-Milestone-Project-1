Please feel free to fork and improve this game. 


Some bugs I need help with:

-Press 's' and 'ArrowDown' at the same time till invalidate 'd' key.

-There is a stutter happening to one player when the other player starts to press a new key.

-Player2 and Player2 can't release arrows at the same time.
